#Project Overview
This project studies Generalized Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis and compare its performance with the standard sparse canonica correlation ananlysis.

All the codes are in the R pakcage scca. See [Github](https://github.com/DongyueXie/scca).

#Analysis

These are the simulations for the project.

1. [Model 1](model1.html): First look.
2. [Model 2](model2.html): Effect of correlation strength.
3. [Model 3](model3.html): Effect of auto-regressive correlation.
4. [Model 4](model4.html): Complex model.
5. [Model 5](model5.html): Effect of dimension.
6. [Model 6](model6.html): Effect of sample size.
7. [Count data 1](count1.html): Count data transformed from normal case
8. [Count data 2](count2.html): Count data from latent variable model
9. [ROC](roc.html)
10. [American Gut Project](realdata.html)
